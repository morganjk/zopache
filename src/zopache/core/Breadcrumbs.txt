So breadcrumbs tell you where you are in a hierarchy.

The first two do the same thing.
They show title if avaiable
They reverence to the .../index pages. 
view.breadcrums*(
view.breadcrumbsIndex()

The following links to the .../manage pages
view.breadcrumbsManage()

And there are some deeper apis.  Read the source code if you need to. 

My original version of breadcrumbs, worked but was messy.

The version used in dolmen.breadcrumbs had some good ideas,
but it is too complex.  In particular it uses an adapter
to get the html for each crumb.  Fine if you
are really reusing components, but for most
beginners, even for me, it was way way too difficult to
understand.

And this version has some additional functionality.
There is one set of breadcrumbs for index views, and another
for manage views.

Anyhow whichever one you use
